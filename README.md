### Hi, I’m Luke 👋

I’m an indie developer who enjoys building simple, useful web tools.

Current focus:
- Keyboard & input testing tools
- Lightweight web utilities
- Fast, minimal UX

Projects:
- keyboardtest.io
- reactiontimetest.io

I like shipping fast, keeping things simple, and learning from real users.
